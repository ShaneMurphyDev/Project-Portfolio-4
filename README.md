## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

 - #### First Time Visitor Goals

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to create an account.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log in/out.
        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see new posts.
        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to  be able to engage with others in a meaningful way.


- #### Frequent User Goals

        - As a Frequent User, I want to be kept up to date with a newsletter.
        - As a Frequent User, I want to take part in discussions and leave comments.
        - As a Frequent User, I want to be able to make my own posts.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The two main colours used are a dark green, pale green, and a very dark grey for contrast.

-   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

-   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is kept to a minimum to keep the users attention of posts, the intention is to guide them into engaging
        with posts by keeping them to focal point.

    - Bootstrap was used to assist with the basic layout.
2. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

### Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. I did learn more towards the end of the project about the use of the agile develepment, and why it's important and usefull to keep track of the whole process and to implement as much as you can. 
I've used Github and the Project Board with use of the Kanban board.

The project board was divided into 3 sections:

  -  To-Do- (All the User stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
  -  In Progress- (then during development story they were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
  -  Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes)
