## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

 - #### First Time Visitor Goals

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to create an account.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log in/out.
        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see new posts.
        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to  be able to engage with others in a meaningful way.


- #### Frequent User Goals

        - As a Frequent User, I want to be kept up to date with a newsletter.
        - As a Frequent User, I want to take part in discussions and leave comments.
        - As a Frequent User, I want to be able to make my own posts.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The two main colours used are

-   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

-   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
