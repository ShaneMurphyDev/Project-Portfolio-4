        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to create an account.

        - As a Frequent User, I want to be able to make my own posts.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The two main colours used are

-   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

-   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
